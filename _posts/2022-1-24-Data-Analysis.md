## Lab Questions and Responses

**1. What dataset did you work with?**
European football is probably the one sport that is most heavily driven by statistics and statistical analysis. The top level is so competitive that stats are so meticulously evaluated with the goal being to gain an advantage somehow. This lab provided me with the opportunity to analyze said statistics. 

**2. Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?**
This dataset quantifies alot of things important to European football, such as physicality and precision. I'd like to see how these individual skills/attributes of a team affects their success. 

**3. Analysis**
In football, possession is important. For many teams, like Manchester City or FC Barcelona, their whole style of play is centered around keeping their ball, it's their philosophy to defend through offense.
