## Lab Questions and Responses

**1. What dataset did you work with?**

European football is probably the one sport that is most heavily driven by statistics and statistical analysis. The top level is so competitive that stats are so meticulously evaluated with the goal being to gain an advantage somehow. This lab provided me with the opportunity to analyze said statistics. These stats are from the 2020/21 season, the season during which Bayern Munich won the Champions League (Europe's largest and most lucrative competition). 

**2. Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?**

This dataset quantifies alot of things important to European football, such as physicality and precision. I'd like to see how these individual skills/attributes of a team affects their success. 

**3. Analysis**

In football, possession is important. For many teams, like Manchester City or FC Barcelona, their whole style of play is centered around keeping their ball, it's their philosophy to defend through offense. I wanted to see if this type of philosophy had any truth to it. Using the scatterplot analysis, I wanted to see if teams with higher levels of possessions scored more goals (goals correlate with success for the sake of this analysis). The scatterplot did infact show that relatively higher levels of possession scored more goals. These teams with higher possession stats also tended to have more shots per goal. This is what was analyzed in the second scatterplot. There was a general trend in that scatterplot that showed that teams that scored more goals, generally tended to have more shots per goal (more shots attempted for a single goal to be scored). The trend was positive, meaning that in the visualization, datapoints seemed to trend upwards. Next, I wanted to focus on how physicality factors into the sport and different tournaments around the world. Thus, I looked at yellow cards and red cards, which are given out to players who have committed fouls during a match. The data was visualized through a distribution plot, and the plot showed that La Liga (the spanish league) had the highest frequency of yellow cards (100+) issued to its competitors. For red cards, it was the French league (ligue 1). This frequency was visualized through light shading on the plots. Some inconsistencies here are that the data doesn't focus on refereeing variations among differing countries/leagues and that countries have different schedules, so fitness can vary from team to team.

**4. Conclusions**
Several conclusions can be derived from the data presented above. From the first scatterplot, it can be concluded that higher levels of possessions resulted in more success. Such a conclusion is supported by the fact that teams with higher levels of possession scored more goals. Furthermore, they were able to take more shots (as supported by the second scatterplot), and more shots meant they were able to make more attempts at scoring a goal. In the third scatterplot, more yellow cards were shown to teams in the Spanish league than any other league, and thus it can be concluded that it is the most physical league. However, there is an inconsistency in that more red cards were issued in the French league.
